## Description
*rr_cache* provides a cache for RetroRules and MetaNetX compounds and reactions

## Requirements
rr_cache has the following dependencies:
- `brs_utils`
- `requests`
- `rdkit`
- `colored`

These dependencies can be installed through conda package manager with:
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge brs_utils requests rdkit colored
```
or by creating a dedicated environment:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

## Install
### From Conda
```sh
[sudo] conda install -c conda-forge rr_cache
```

## Use

All cache data are stored into files on disk and loaded in memory each time the tool is used. Memory fingerprint is equal to the size of cache files loaded in memory multiplied by the number of processes which are running at the same time.

If the cache is present in the current working directory, it will be used. Otherwise, it will be downloaded from the remote repository. If it not possible to download the cache, either because it is not possible to reach it remotely or because the option `--do-not-dwnl-cache` is set, it will be generated from scratch.

### Load rrCache in memory
```python
from rr_cache import rrCache

cache = rrCache()
print(cache.cid_strc)
```

**A part of cache**
For less loading time and memory footprint, a part of the cache can be loaded:
```python
from rr_cache import rrCache

cache = rrCache(['cid_strc'])
cache.get_compound('MNXM2')
```
***From CLI***
```sh
python -m rr_cache --reaction-rules <RuleID_1> <RuleID_2>...
```
If `RuleID_i` is(are) set, prints out the reaction rule(s) or all reaction rules if nothing is specified.

```sh
python -m rr_cache --reactions <RxnID_1> <RxnID_2>...
```
If `RxnID_i` is(are) set, prints out the reaction(s) or all reactions if nothing is specified.

```sh
python -m rr_cache --compounds <CmpdID_1> <CmpdID_2>...
```
If `CmpdID_i` is(are) set, prints out the compound(s) or all compounds if nothing is specified.

```sh
python -m rr_cache --data-type <DataType>
```
If `DataType` is set, set the data type of the cache (default is `mnx3.1`).

### (Re-)build the cache
**From Python code**
```python
from rr_cache import rrCache

rrCache.Build(outdir)
```

**From CLI**
```sh
python -m rr_cache --build <folder>
```
